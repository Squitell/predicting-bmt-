# Medical Decision Support Application

## Project Report

### Introduction
This project focuses on developing a decision-support application to assist physicians in predicting the success rate of pediatric bone marrow transplants. The objective is to create a reliable and explainable machine learning model that ensures transparency in medical predictions.

### Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:
- Developing an explainable machine learning model to predict transplant success.
- Ensuring transparency through SHAP-based explainability.
- Building a user-friendly interface using Streamlit or Flask.
- Implementing professional software development practices, including GitHub and CI/CD automation.
- Exploring prompt engineering by documenting AI-generated prompts used in the workflow.

### Dataset Used
The dataset utilized in this project is available at: [Bone Marrow Transplant Children Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/565/bone+marrow+transplant+children)

### Data Processing and Analysis
- **Handling Missing Values:** The dataset was analyzed for missing values and appropriate techniques were used to handle them.
- **Outliers Detection:** Any significant outliers were identified and addressed.
- **Class Imbalance:** The dataset showed an imbalance (approximately 60% survival and 40% non-survival). Techniques applied to handle this included:
  - Oversampling using SMOTE.
  - Undersampling.
  - Adjusting class weights.
- **Feature Correlation:** Highly correlated features were identified and managed accordingly.

### Machine Learning Models Tested
To ensure optimal performance, multiple machine learning models were evaluated, including:
- Random Forest Classifier
- XGBoost Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- LightGBM Classifier

**Evaluation Metrics Used:** The models were assessed based on ROC-AUC, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Memory Optimization Strategy
- A custom function `optimize_memory(df)` was implemented to enhance memory efficiency by optimizing data types.
- The improvements in memory usage before and after optimization were documented.

### SHAP Explainability Integration
- SHAP visualizations were used to interpret the modelâ€™s decision-making process.
- Summary plots were generated to highlight the most influential features.
- The user interface included SHAP-based explanations to enhance model transparency.

### User Interface Development
A simple and interactive user interface was designed using Streamlit/Flask to:
- Allow medical professionals to input patient details.
- Display predictions regarding transplant success.
- Provide SHAP-based explanations for better interpretability.

### Project Management and Workflow
- The project was managed using Trello, ensuring structured task distribution and progress tracking.
- A professional GitHub repository was maintained, following best practices in version control and collaborative development.
- A GitHub Actions workflow was implemented to automate testing and CI/CD processes.

### Prompt Engineering Exploration
- AI-generated prompts were utilized for specific project tasks, including data processing and model evaluation.
- The effectiveness of these prompts was analyzed, and improvements were suggested for better efficiency.

### Key Findings and Insights
- **Dataset Imbalance:** The class imbalance was addressed through multiple techniques, improving model performance.
- **Best Performing Model:** After evaluation, the model with the highest performance metrics was selected and justified.
- **Key Influential Features:** SHAP analysis identified the most critical clinical factors affecting transplant success.
- **Prompt Engineering Insights:** The impact of AI-assisted prompt generation on project efficiency was examined.

### Final Deliverables
The final project submission includes:
- A well-structured and documented codebase.
- Detailed exploratory data analysis reports.
- A trained ML model integrated with SHAP-based explainability.
- An intuitive web-based interface.
- A functional CI/CD pipeline via GitHub Actions.
- A memory optimization module.
- Comprehensive documentation covering all aspects of the project.

### Submission Deadline
The final project submission is due on **Sunday, March 16 at noon.**

### Conclusion
This project has provided valuable insights into the intersection of machine learning and medical decision support. By integrating SHAP explainability and best software development practices, we have developed a reliable tool that aids physicians in making informed transplant decisions.
